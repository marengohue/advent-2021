# Philosophy
I personally feel like the base ruleset of the game does not lead to fun gameplay, so I opted to come up with my own spin on the rules which I find more fun:

- Time is not a factor, so I can take as much or as little time to come up with the solution
- Try to generalize solution to solve both 1st and 2nd part of the problem in a single piece of code (it could be done via parametrization or a macro or in any other way.)
- Use the language I would like to use more of, but don't use enough of. Get out of my comfort zone.
